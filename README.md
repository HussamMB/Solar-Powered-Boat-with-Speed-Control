# Solar-Powered-Boat-with-Speed-Control
This project involves the design and development of a model boat that relies only on solar energy, to reduce the cost and the environmental damage caused by the fossil fuel, the solar boat efficiently utilize the solar energy to function properly for a sufficient time.
In this project, it is proposed to build a boat that is solely dependent on solar power, solar panel is installed on the boat to convert solar energy to electrical energy, a charge controller to ensure a safe and proper charging of the battery, the battery is connected to the motor of the boat.
The charge controller uses the concept of MPPT to provide the maximum power to the motor and the battery.
The motor speed can be controlled.
